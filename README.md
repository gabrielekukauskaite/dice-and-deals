# Dice & Deals (wip)

[Demo](https://dice-and-deals.vercel.app/)

To put a long story short this is a personal project to practice all things frontend while working on something that I enjoy doing in my free time: buying and playing board games.

The aim is to create a website for finding interesting boardgames and seeing how much would it cost to get one delivered in the UK.
It combines boardgamegeek.com api with boardgameprices.co.uk api to achieve the above.

While the aforementioned websites are very functional they don't really spark much joy, so I wanted something colorful, modern, and different... That's why I decided to go for a neobrutalism(ish) style which felt like a perfect theme to experiment with.

Here is a screenshot displaying 50 most popular games:
